PHONEPE PULSE DATA VISUALIZATION AND EXPLORATION
(Using MySQL, Plotly and Streamlit)

DESCRIPTION:

The problem statement is to create a Streamlit application that allows users to access and analyze data from Phonepe Pulse data from Github.

TECHNOLOGIES NEED TO KNOW:

•	Python
•	Plotly Library
•	MySQL
•	Streamlit Library


SOFTWARE REQUIRED:

•	VSCode
•	MySQL Workbench
•	Updated web browser

REQUIRED LIBRARIES TO INSTALL:

pip install, mysql-connector-python, pandas, streamlit, plotly.

INTRODUCTION:

This project is a YouTube API scrapper that allows users to clone the data from Github, store it in database and use those data to visualize. It utilizes the Phonepe Pulse data arranged state, year and quarter wise to visualize and analysis using Bar chart and geo map visualization.


TECHNOLOGIES USED:

	Python: The project is implemented using the Python programming language.

	Streamlit: The user interface and visualization are created using the Streamlit framework, providing a seamless and interactive experience.

	MySQL: A powerful open-source relational database management system used to store and manage the retrieved data.

	MySQL-Connector: A MySQL adapter for Python that allows seamless integration between Python and MySQL. It enables the YouTube Data Scraper to connect to and interact with the PostgreSQL database.

	Pandas: A powerful data manipulation and analysis library in Python. Pandas is used in the YouTube Data Scraper to handle and process data obtained from YouTube, providing functionalities such as data filtering, transformation, and aggregation.

ETL PROCESS:

	 Extracting Data from Github repo using cloning method.

     Transforming data into the data frame.

     Loading Data into MySQL as structured data.

Learning outcomes of this project:

1.	Data extraction and processing: Learning how to use Clone Github to extract data from a repository and pre-process the data using Python libraries such as Pandas.

2.	Database management: Use a relational database such as MySQL to store data and retrieve it efficiently for analysis and visualization.

3.	Visualization and dashboard creation: To use libraries such as Streamlit and Plotly to create interactive and visually appealing dashboards for data visualization.


4.	Geo visualization: Create and display data on a map using Plotly's built-in geo map functions.

5.	Dynamic updating: Create a dashboard that dynamically updates based on the latest data in a database.


6.	Project development and deployment: Develop a comprehensive and user-friendly solution, from data extraction to dashboard deployment. Also learn how to test and deploy the solution to ensure it is secure, efficient, and user-friendly.
